************************

Tweets can be classified with our demographic classifier with classify.py.
The classifier uses the Python module langid.py, which can be downloaded here
(https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) or installed using pip (pip install
langid).

The demographic model's full vocabulary and count tables (averaged over the 
last 50 Gibbs sampling iterations) are in vocab.txt and model_count_table.txt, 
respectively. The demographic predictions for a tweet can be calculated by 
loading the model with predict.load_model(model_count_table) and calling 
predict.predict(tweet). The model only needs to be loaded once per session.

Tokenizing for the paper was done using twokenize.py and emoji detection was
done with emoji.py; both are provided.

The evaluation of our annotated dataset for the paper was done with evaluate.py
in the research/ directory; we include it for replicability.
